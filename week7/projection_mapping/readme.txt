This design used photo-transistors to detect light from projector. Projector uses strips to encode each pixel in a unique sequence in binary. Then position of each photo-transistor can be detected and the projection can be calibrated easily.

There still needs some polishment on sensor filtering because projector is flickering at a non-sensible speed to us, but sensible to photo-transistor.
